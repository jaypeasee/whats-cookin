## Project:

What's Cookin'?

### Group Member Names:

JP Carey and Cooper Terrones

### Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):

#### JP:

More practice with iterator methods and also excited to be making an app that is much more dynamic in design and functionality than anything previously.

#### Cooper:

Becoming more confident and resourceful with project work and problem solving.

#### As a team:

Get at least a 3 in all required rubrics for passing while not getting too stressed out on a day to day basis. We want to trust in our abilities and routine to get us there. Being concious and respectful of each other's learning, time, and expected working pace.

If we're having fun with the project, and if we're proud of the work we've done that is a big sign of success for us. Positive feedback from our project manager, Bob, will demonstrate to us that we've done a good job with the project.

### Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

We think we will compliment each other nicely during this project. We are already accountabilibuddies so we are already comfortable and honest with one another and we're aware of how both of us want to improve. We have an understanding of what motivates us and how we address our own self care. We have no issue being honest with each other because we find feedback to be helpful from each other.

### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

#### JP:

Very stubborn and persistent when seeing a problem that is tricky or super challenging. Not giving up to find the answer and undertsand why it's the answer.

#### Cooper:

Keeping an even keel when things do get tricky or tedious. That's helpful for putting problems into perspective so that they can maybe reapproached.

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):

Project partners are on the same time zone. Cooper has a work shift on Sundays so there won't be paired programming then. JP cuts off work after 10:00PM every night, so no paired programming then. JP does preteaching and jsFun before classes on weekdays so no paired programming before 9:00AM.

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Communicate daily on Slack or text. We're going to be honest and direct with each other to keep lines of communication open. Make sure to check asynchornous communication multiple times a day.

If we're not immediately on the same page, we commit to listening to understand what the other person is thinking or proposing. After both people have their ideas articulated, we can compare and make a decision by consensus.

We're pretty used to talking about self care with one another, so we'll just need to stay consistent with that.

### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

Knowing that we will need to self teach and pre teach lessons as we need to work because the project progression will likely be well ahead of our lessons that are relevant to the iterations.

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

We both want to work on the entire project. We plan to switch off between drivers consistently. We both plan to be navigators at all times though to keep us engaged and to help solve the complexities of the project efficiently.

### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):

Github Project Board, atomic commits, well documents pull requests and thorough reviews, using Tuple for paired programming when we can, mentors and rocks for code review, and well documented tests will be the key here.

### Pomodoro Break Schedule:

Aim for taking a 5 minute break every 30 minutes.

### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Welcome all sorts of feedback, but there is no pressure to give coaching feedback if we don't feel like there is nothing to give.
